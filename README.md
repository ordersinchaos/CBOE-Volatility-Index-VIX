# Data
CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) time-series dataset including trading date, daily bid, ask, volumn, maturity and strike from 2018.1.2 to 2019.12.31.
This notebook shows how to reproduce the VIX given the 50ETF data. Details of calculation process are in CBOE White Paper (http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf). The code works for any option data set, not only one day as in the White Paper.
